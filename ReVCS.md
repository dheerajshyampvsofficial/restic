# Note: Integration of RevCS with Restic
### Introduction
This patch introduces a basic integration point between RevCS, a Java-based encryption-enabled version control system, and Restic, enhancing the capabilities of both tools. The goal is to allow users to leverage RevCS for secure snapshot management while using Restic for backups.

**3. Docker**: hub.docker.com/r/dheerajshyampvsofficial/revcs

### Proposed Integration Approach

#### 1. Command-Line Integration:

Users can call the RevCS with cli in go code before or after using Restic for backups.

###### Ex:
revcs add <folder/file> # Indexing
revcs store <name> # Snapshotting
revcs unpack <name> # Unpacking the encrypted and compressed snapshot into original form. 

#### 2. JRE inside Go:
Here is where, I think the single integration can happen. Wrapping JRE inside restic source code to efficiently execute ***Java* *Scripts*** can help leverage the power of simple VCS with revcs and efficient backup with restic. For this, we can work collaboratively and make this work. 

### 3. Java to Go bridge
We can also develop a wrapper around the Java code that allows it to be called from Go.

### 4. Rest API
If feasible, expose the functionality of RevCS through a REST API, allowing Go to interact with Java components easily.

# How to Get Involved
If you're interested in contributing to the integration, here are some steps to get started:

**1. Review the code in this PR and provide feedback.**
**2. Join discussions in the Restic GitHub issues or forums about the best approaches for integrating Java functionality.**
**3. Collaborate with others who might have experience in bridging Java and Go, and share your ideas!**

# Conclusion
This integration opens up possibilities for enhancing both Restic's functionality and RevCSâ€™s user base. We look forward to collaborating with the community on this effort!
